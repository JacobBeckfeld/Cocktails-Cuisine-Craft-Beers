As a group we created a restaurant, brewery  and and cocktail recipe search!

We split into a front-end and a back-end in the begining of our project to get both the styling and the functionality working.
    By doing this we were able to cut the time it would take us to build the whole website.
    We had one team form the UI and styling of both HTML pages and the other create the functionality through javascript.

Our website starts at our landing page that describes what you are able to search for.
    When you press restaurants cocktails or brewries link it will take you to the search page which will then allow you to search through three different APIs.

On the results HTML page you are able to choose what you want to search; either cocktail recipies, resturants in a specific area by zip code or a brewery ny a specific zip code.
    Each search option searches through a different API to find what the user is looking for.

With this you will be able to either find a restaurant or a brewery near you, or if you'd rather, make a cocktail at home!
